*What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?*

- Safety and Security
- Clarity
- Approachability
- Developer Experience
- Resource Oriented Programming

*In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?*

In general, when it comes to building software, platforms are only as good as the software that developers that are building on top of them.  One issue with other blockchains is that the developer experience is very bad and often it is difficult (and stressful) to write secure programs. Security is always important for developers, but given that blockchains are basically programmable money, it's even more crucial that security is a priority. By focusing on Developer Experience, Flow can attract the best developers and give them the confidence to build the best software while having the confidence of knowing that a large class of security issues is not going to be a problem with Flow.
